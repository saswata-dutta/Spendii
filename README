Spendii
-------

Spendii is a simple personal finance API written in Scala. Spendii was written more to tease out the
workings of Scala than to provide a comprehensive personal finance API.

Spendii is built using SBT. Please have a look @ the SBT website for instructions on how to install it -> http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/DocumentationHome

Once SBT is installed simpy run:

;update;clean;test

to verify that everything compiles and that the tests pass.

Examples of API usage can be found in the spendii-examples project.
